# Optimisation workshop

This repo includes a few notebooks I used when hosting an educational workshop during my time at AstraZeneca.

The notebooks offer an introduction to very simple LP/MIP problems, and leverage Google's OR-tools.

To get started, clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:IkerPerez/optimisation_workshop.git
```

Then, navigate to the repo folder in your local machine, and set up a virtual environment with the corresponding dependencies. Assuming you have pipenv setup:
```
pipenv install --skip-lock
```
